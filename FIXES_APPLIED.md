# Audio Analysis App - Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. PyTorch/Streamlit Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: `RuntimeError: Tried to instantiate class '__path__._path', but it does not exist!`

**Root Cause**: Streamlit's file watcher was trying to inspect PyTorch's custom classes, causing a conflict.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added environment variables to disable Streamlit's file watcher
- Added PyTorch import protection in `main.py`
- Created `.streamlit/config.toml` with optimized settings
- Updated `run_app.bat` with compatibility flags

### 2. Large Data Transfer Issue
**Problem**: `Data of size 807.0 MB exceeds the message size limit of 200.0 MB`

**Root Cause**: Large audio files were being transferred in full to the browser for visualization.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Increased Streamlit message size limit to 1000MB
- Added data sampling in waveform visualization (max 10,000 points)
- Added duration limiting in spectrogram (max 60 seconds)
- Optimized visualization resolution for large files

### 3. Python Environment Path Issues
**Problem**: Python executable not found in expected locations

**Solution**: Located correct Python path at `.conda\python.exe`

## Files Modified

1. **main.py**
   - Added PyTorch/Streamlit compatibility fixes at the top
   - Added environment variable settings

2. **ui/components.py**
   - Added data sampling to `render_waveform()` function
   - Added duration limiting to `render_spectrogram()` function
   - Added performance optimization messages

3. **.streamlit/config.toml** (NEW)
   - Configured message size limits
   - Disabled file watcher
   - Set browser options

4. **run_app.bat**
   - Added environment variables for compatibility
   - Added Streamlit command-line options

5. **restart_app.bat** (NEW)
   - Script to cleanly restart the application
   - Clears cache and kills existing processes

## How to Use

### Option 1: Use the updated run script
```bash
run_app.bat
```

### Option 2: Use the restart script (if app is already running)
```bash
restart_app.bat
```

### Option 3: Manual restart
1. Kill any existing Streamlit processes
2. Clear cache: `rmdir /s /q .cache`
3. Run: `.conda\Scripts\streamlit.exe run main.py --server.fileWatcherType=none --server.maxMessageSize=1000`

## Performance Optimizations

- **Waveform Display**: Automatically samples large audio files to 10,000 points
- **Spectrogram Display**: Limits to first 60 seconds of audio
- **Memory Management**: Reduced resolution for long audio files
- **Cache Management**: Automatic cleanup on restart

## Environment Variables Set

- `STREAMLIT_SERVER_FILE_WATCHER_TYPE=none`
- `STREAMLIT_BROWSER_GATHER_USAGE_STATS=false`
- `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=hf_lQaWzxI...` (existing)

## Verification

Your PyTorch installation is working correctly:
- ✅ torch: 2.5.1+cu121
- ✅ torchvision: 0.20.1+cu121  
- ✅ CUDA available: True
- ✅ transformers.WhisperProcessor imports successfully

The issues were compatibility-related, not installation problems.
